<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
  EclEmma is a free Java code coverage tool for
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, available under the 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License</a>.
  Internally it is based on the great <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a>
  Java code coverage tool, trying to adopt EMMA's philosophy for the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fast develop/test cycle:</b> Launches from within the workbench like
  JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.</li>
  <li><b>Rich coverage analysis:</b> Coverage results are immediately summarized
  and highlighted in the Java source code editors.</li>
  <li><b>Non-invasive:</b> EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or
  performing any other setup.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Eclipse integration has its focus on supporting the individual developer
  in an highly interactive way.
</p>

<p>
  The latest version can be downloaded
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=177969&amp;package_id=205096">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p>
  EclEmma adds a so called <i>launch mode</i> to the Eclipse workbench. It is
  called <i>Coverage</i> mode and works exactly like the existing <i>Run</i> and
  <i>Debug</i> modes. The <i>Coverage</i> launch mode can be activated from the
  <i>Run</i> menu or the workbench's toolbar:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  Simply launch your applications or unit tests in the <i>Coverage</i> mode to
  collect coverage information. Currently the following launch types are
  supported:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Java application</li>
  <li>Eclipse/RCP application</li>
  <li>JUnit test</li>
  <li>JUnit plug-in test</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
  After your application or unit test has terminated code coverage information
  is automatically available in the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage overview:</b> The <i>Coverage</i> view lists coverage
  summaries for your Java projects, allowing drill-down to method level.</li>
  
  <li><b>Source highlighting:</b> The result of a coverage session is also 
  directly visible in the Java source editors. A customizable color code
  highlights fully, partly and not covered lines. This works for your own source
  code as well as for source attached to instrumented external libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additional features support analysis for your test coverage:
</p>

<ul>  
  <li><b>Different counters:</b> Select whether instructions, lines, basic
  blocks, methods or loaded types should be summarized.</li>
  <li><b>Multiple coverage sessions:</b> Switching between coverage data from
  multiple sessions is possible.</li>
  <li><b>Merge Sessions:</b> If multiple different test runs should be considered
  for analysis coverage sessions can easily be merged.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Import/Export</h3>

<p>
  While EclEmma is primarily designed for test runs and analysis within the
  Eclipse workbench, it provides some import/export features.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage data import:</b> A wizard allows to import <code>*.ec</code>
  coverage data files from external launches.</li>
  <li><b>Coverage report export:</b> Coverage data can be exported as a
  <code>*.ec</code> file or in XML or HTML format.</li>
</ul>
