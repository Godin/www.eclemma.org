<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>
  Design decisions for the EclEmma plug-in should be based on the following
  guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A high usability should allow developers to efficiently analyse coverage
  results and improve test coverage interactively. Technically motivated extra
  steps must be avoided.</li>
  <li>Seamless integration into the Eclipse workbench: Use existing tools and
  paradigms; adopt the Eclipse look &amp; feel.</li>
  <li>The primary focus are local launches and interactive coverage analysis
  within the Eclipse workbench. For automated builds and report generation
  JaCoCo's various <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/integrations.html">integrations</a>
  with build tools like Ant and Maven are the better choice.</li>
  <li>No project modification: Coverage analysis is a way to look at your
  projects, but it is not an inherent part of your projects. Therefore a coverage
  tool should work without touching your project's source tree or configuration.</li>
  <li>Extensibility: Allow other developers to extend EclEmma's functionality
  or build new features using the services provided by EclEmma.</li>
  <li>And finally: Keep it simple!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following sections provide a high level overview about EclEmma's key
  implementation strategies.
</p>

<h3>Separate Backend from GUI</h3>

<p>
  EclEmma is packaged in two plug-ins: The core plug-in offers all functionality
  for launching and analysis. It has no dependencies on the Eclipse UI and all
  functionality can also be used in <i>headless</i> mode. The JUnit tests for
  the core plug-in run <i>headless</i>. The UI plug-in provides the workbench
  integration and relies on the core's public API only. This approach also
  verifies the usability of the core API.
</p>

<h3>JaCoCo Execution Data Files</h3>

<p>
  To avoid modifying projects all data files are stored in the plug-in's state
  location.
</p>

<h3>Launching in Coverage Mode</h3>

<p>
  Instead of re-implementing launcher for the different launch types, the
  existing launchers for the <i>Run</i> mode are used with adjusted launch
  configurations. The coverage launchers perform these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a temporary working copy of the launch configuration and adjust the
  VM arguments to add the JaCoCo agent to the Java VM.</li>
  <li>Delegate to the launcher for <i>Run</i> mode of the same launch type.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Coverage Session</h3>

<p>
  A coverage session (<code>com.mountainminds.eclemma.core.ICoverageSession</code>)
  is the result of a coverage run (or multiple merged runs) or coverage data
  imported from an external source. It is an immutable container for all data
  necessary to
</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>provide coverage highlighting in Java editors,</li>
  <li>populate the <i>Coverage</i> view and</li>
  <li>export coverage reports in different formats.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Whenever a coverage launch terminates a coverage session is automatically
  created. While there can be a list of coverage sessions, at most one session
  can be the <i>active session</i> which is used to provide coverage summaries
  for Java elements and source code highlighting.
</p>

<h3>Coverage Analysis</h3>

<p>
  As soon as a coverage session becomes active the corresponding execution data
  is processed and analyzed against the classes in the workspace. Coverage
  information is described by a <code>org.jacoco.core.analysis.ICoverageNode</code>
  instances for each Java model element (see <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core</code>
  package). An adapter factory allows obtaining the corresponding
  <code>ICoverageNode</code> instances for a particular Java model element via
  <code>IJavaElement.getAdapter()</code>.
</p>

<h3>Editor Highlighting</h3>

<p>
  The EclEmma UI plug-in tracks the currently opened Java editors and
  piggybacks a specialized annotation model to the editors' annotation model.
